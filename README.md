# Sales-analysis-PowerBI

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a data analysis project that involves importing and analyzing a database of chocolate sales data using SQL and creating interactive reports in Power BI. The project aims to provide valuable insights into chocolate sales trends and key performance indicators (KPIs) using Parameters for dynamic reporting capabilities.

## Project Highlights
Data Source: The project starts with importing a database in SQL, which includes over 7000 rows of data with attributes such as location, salesperson, product, category, and sales information.
SQL Analysis: The data in the DB was already clean, as the importance in this project was to create a dynamic report in PowerBI and not the eda in SQL.
Power BI Reports: Hence, the data was directly imported into Power BI to create reports. These reports showcase important KPIs and sales trends in an easily digestible format.
Parameter Functionality: The project demonstrates the use of parameter functions in Power BI instead of traditional filtering methods. This dynamic reporting approach enhances the flexibility and usability of the reports.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Pratham-Sachdeva/Sales-analysis-PowerBI.git
The SQL file can directly be loaded to PoweBI using Get Data option.
The Power BI report file can be used to explore the visualized data.
